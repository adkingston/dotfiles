          <p>Mon, Dec 12, 2016 &mdash; 
          3511 words &mdash; Read in 17 min</p>
            
              <img class="post-pic img-rounded", src="/assets/arch-rice-mono.jpg">
            
            <p>So. You&rsquo;ve decided to make the switch to Arch Linux and you&rsquo;ve got your Xorg
display configured with a little help from the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch wiki</a>,
but this distro doesn&rsquo;t look <strong>anything</strong> like you&rsquo;ve seen advertised!?! Or
maybe it does and all you were expecting were a few tty&rsquo;s&hellip; <em>who am I to
judge</em>? Anyhow, I&rsquo;m here to talk about making that barebone system into
something you can look at in admiration. I&rsquo;m here to talk about ricing.</p>
<p>This will be the first part of a series focusing on ricing Arch Linux, and as
the title implies, this part is about window managers. In this tutorial series,
I&rsquo;ll try to demystify the beutification of a Unix-based OS.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-ricing">What is Ricing?</h3>
<p>From the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary#wiki_rice">/r/unixporn wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Rice&rsquo; is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements
and customizations on one&rsquo;s desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is most commonly done on Unix platforms such as Linux and Mac OS / OSX
because these operating systems are capable of using user-selected components
of an operating system, which brings us to the next topic.</p>
<h3 id="visual-components-of-an-operating-system">Visual Components of an Operating System</h3>
<p>An operating system has many visual components but the following are among the
most basic and notable and are usually the subject of ricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window Manager</li>
<li>Terminal Emulator (ok, ok, this isn&rsquo;t REALLY necessary)</li>
<li>Status Bar</li>
<li>Widget / Window Theme &amp; Other Tidbits (Composition Manager, Application
Launcher, Screen Saver, Fonts, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listed these elements in the order in which I&rsquo;ll discuss them in my posts,
and I&rsquo;ll touch on each of them here briefly.</p>
<p>A <strong>window manager</strong> configures the layout, borders, and actions of
windows displayed on the screen. This includes, but is not limited to, where a
window is placed when opened (relative to other windows as well as which
virtual workspace it is placed on), the color and thickness of a window&rsquo;s
border, which controls are used to close, enlarge, and shrink the window, as
well as which interfaces the user can use to control the windows (keyboard
shortcuts, mouse gestures, etc.) Some of my favorite examples of window
managers are <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3 Window Manager</a> and <a href="http://xmonad.org">XMonad Window Manager</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>terminal emulator</strong> is a progam providing the user with an interface through
which to communicate with the computer. This is typically done with text
input / output. The terminal also provides a home for the user&rsquo;s shell of
choice (be it bash, zsh, fish, or another). The terminal emulator can be
customized in many ways including changing the font style, the shell prompt,
the color scheme, and other elements of the terminal&rsquo;s appearance. Some
examples of terminal emulators are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt">rxvt</a> and <a href="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/">xterm</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>status bar</strong> is where system information is diplayed: which windows are
open, which virtual desktops are active, current time and date, network status,
etc. Like the terminal emulator, a status bar can be configured to use custom
font styles and special color schemes as well as display whichever system
information the user deems fit. Some examples of status bars are <a href="https://i3wm.org/i3bar/">i3bar</a>
(which is used in conjuction with the i3 window manager) and <a href="http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/">xmobar</a>
(which can be used as a standalone status bar or in conjuction with xmonad
window manager).</p>
<h3 id="configuring-a-window-manager-i3">Configuring a Window Manager (i3)</h3>
<p>Configuring a window manager is often the first step to ricing a system. I&rsquo;ve
used a few different window managers, and I find i3 to be the easiest to
approach (unless you&rsquo;re familiar with the Haskell programming language, in
which case, XMonad may be your cup of tea).</p>
<p>Setting up a window manager consists of three main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install the package</li>
<li>Start the window manager</li>
<li>Tweak the hell out of the settings until you&rsquo;re satisfied</li>
</ol>
<p>The third step is the most interesting but for completeness, I&rsquo;ll include the
first two steps as well.</p>
<h4 id="downloading-and-installing-i3-gaps">Downloading and Installing i3-gaps</h4>
<p>The source code for i3 gaps (an unofficial but commonly used fork of the
original i3 window manager) can be found <a href="https://github.com/Airblader/i3">here</a>. Since I&rsquo;ll be using Arch
Linux, I&rsquo;ll download and install i3-gaps using the Arch User Repository (AUR),
but if you&rsquo;re using something other than Arch, you can find installation
instructions for your package manager of choice (or via manual installation)
<a href="https://github.com/Airblader/i3/wiki/Compiling-&amp;-Installing">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll use yaourt to download and install i3-gaps like so:</p>
<pre><code>yaourt i3-gaps-git
</code></pre><p>yaourt should prompt you to install some basic dependencies which include
i3bar and i3status. You should accept the recommendation because i3bar and
i3status will provide you with a nice initial status bar (albeit one with
default configurations) which you can modify later.</p>
<h4 id="starting-i3-gaps-on-login">Starting i3-gaps on Login</h4>
<p>The next step is to configure your system to start <em>i3</em>
window manager with the X Window System. This can be done using a program
called <em>xinit</em>. <em>xinit</em> is mainly used to execute desktop environments, window
managers, and other programs when starting the X Server (including the X
Window System) at the beginning of a user&rsquo;s XSession (typically after login).
<em>xinit</em> is included in the <em>xorg-xinit</em> package and can be
installed with the following command on Arch Linux:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pacman -S xorg-xinit
</code></pre><p>The <em>xinit</em> program uses a shell script to determine which window manager
(and, possibly, other auxillery programs) to execute after starting the X
Window System. A default shell script used by <em>xinit</em> can be found at
<code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc</code>. We&rsquo;ll examine the default shell script to
understand what is going on under-the-hood, then we&rsquo;ll make a copy of the
script and tailor it to our liking. Here is the default shell script:</p>
<pre><code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f &quot;$userresources&quot; ]; then
    xrdb -merge &quot;$userresources&quot;
fi

if [ -f &quot;$usermodmap&quot; ]; then
    xmodmap &quot;$usermodmap&quot;
fi

# start some nice programs

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ] ; then
 for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?*.sh ; do
  [ -x &quot;$f&quot; ] &amp;&amp; . &quot;$f&quot;
 done
 unset f
fi

twm &amp;
xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &amp;
xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &amp;
xterm -geometry 80x20+494-0 &amp;
exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login
</code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ll break the script down into two pieces. The first piece:</p>
<pre><code>userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f &quot;$userresources&quot; ]; then
    xrdb -merge &quot;$userresources&quot;
fi

if [ -f &quot;$usermodmap&quot; ]; then
    xmodmap &quot;$usermodmap&quot;
fi
</code></pre><p>This portion of the shell script checks to see if there are any system-wide or
user-specific configuration files for X resources (configuration parameters
used by X client applications). If such configuration files exist, the
configurations are merged into the existing configurations. The shell script
also checks to see if there are any system-wide or user-specific xmodmap
configuration files. These files are used by the xmodmap program to modify
key mappings and pointer button mappings. <em><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about these
configuration files just yet, they will be covered in more depth in the post
regarding customization of the terminal emulator</strong></em></p>
<p>The second piece:</p>
<pre><code># start some nice programs

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ] ; then
 for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?*.sh ; do
  [ -x &quot;$f&quot; ] &amp;&amp; . &quot;$f&quot;
 done
 unset f
fi

twm &amp;
xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &amp;
xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &amp;
xterm -geometry 80x20+494-0 &amp;
exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login
</code></pre><p>This portion of the shell script is responsible for starting all programs
needed after the X Window System is started. It checks if any executable shell
scripts exist in <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/</code> and if so, it will execute those
scripts. It then launches <em>twm</em> (tabbed window manager), xclock, and three
instances of xterm.</p>
<p><em><strong>It is important to note</strong></em>: the last instance of xterm
invoked is done so using the exec command rather than launching it in the
background (using &amp;) like the others. The X Window System is a group of
child processes whose parent is the <em>xinit</em> program. Therefore, if the <em>xinit</em>
program exits, so will the X Window System (bye, bye, GUI). By calling exec on
the last instance of xterm, the shell script&rsquo;s process will be passed to xterm
instead and the X Window System will not exit unless the xterm process
is killed.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what <em>xinit</em> is doing under-the-hood, we can begin to
alter the <em>xinitrc</em> shell script to do what we want. Namely, we&rsquo;d like to
launch the i3-gaps window manager instead of <em>twm</em>.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll copy the default config to the user-specific configuration
directory, <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.</p>
<pre><code>cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
</code></pre><p>Then we&rsquo;ll remove the last 5 lines of the default configuration and add
<code>exec i3-gaps</code> instead, like so:</p>
<pre><code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f &quot;$userresources&quot; ]; then
    xrdb -merge &quot;$userresources&quot;
fi

if [ -f &quot;$usermodmap&quot; ]; then
    xmodmap &quot;$usermodmap&quot;
fi

# start some nice programs

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ] ; then
 for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?*.sh ; do
  [ -x &quot;$f&quot; ] &amp;&amp; . &quot;$f&quot;
 done
 unset f
fi

exec i3-gaps
</code></pre><p><em><strong>Note that we&rsquo;ve now replaced the</strong></em> <code>exec xterm</code> <em><strong>with</strong></em> <code>exec i3-gaps</code>,
<em><strong>therefore, if the i3-gaps window manager exits, then so will the X Window
System.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve done everything up to this step, when you log into a tty after
booting Arch, you should be greeted by an X Window System running the i3-gaps
window manager, i3bar (shows virtual desktops, is interactive), and i3status
(shows system information)! Hurray!</p>
<h4 id="tweaking-i3-gaps-config">Tweaking i3-gaps Config</h4>
<p>The i3-gaps window manager (if being run for the first
time) will prompt you with a brief configuration wizard asking you which key
you&rsquo;d like to use as your Mod key. The Mod key is just a special key used for
key bindings. Many people set it to the Windows key or the Command key (Apple).</p>
<p>Something you might want to know right away is that the default key binding
for launching a terminal in i3 is Mod+Enter.</p>
<p>The configuration wizard will also copy the global configuration file
from <code>/etc/i3/config</code> to <code>~/.config/i3/config</code> and this is where all your
user-specific changes will be made.</p>
<p>We can see the file here:</p>
<pre><code>~/.config/i3/config
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.

# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
#font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 8

# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesnâ€™t scale on retina/hidpi displays.

}
</code></pre><p>The i3 configuration file and commands are very readable and the default
configuration generated has some useful comments. Some immediate things to
point out are the <code>bindsym</code> and <code>set</code> commands.</p>
<p>The <code>bindsym</code> command binds a particular key combination to an i3 command. One
example is <code>bindsym $mod+r mode &quot;resize&quot;</code> which binds the Mod+r key
combination to resize mode. In resize mode, you can resize the current
window in focus using <code>j</code> (shrink width), <code>k</code> (grow height), <code>l</code> (shrink height),
or <code>;</code> (grow width). You can then exit resize mode with the escape key.</p>
<p>The <code>set</code> command sets i3 variables to particular values. These values can be
other i3 variables, i3 key codes, or literal values. An example is <code>set $left  j</code> which
sets the variable <code>left</code> to the <code>j</code> key. As you may have noticed, i3 variables
are always prefixed with the <code>$</code> symbol, even when being set. Similar to the
example you could say <code>set $ws1 &quot;Workspace #1&quot;</code> in order to set the variable
<code>ws1</code> to the literal <code>&quot;Workspace #1&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>When changes are made to the configuration file, you can check the changes
take effect by using the restart command in i3 which is bound to Mod+Shift+r.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>set</code> command to define names for our workspaces to
avoid typing the literal names more than once. This can be done by the
following:</p>
<pre><code># set variables for workspace titles
set $ws1 &quot;1&quot;
set $ws2 &quot;2&quot;
set $ws3 &quot;3&quot;
set $ws4 &quot;4&quot;
set $ws5 &quot;5&quot;
set $ws6 &quot;6&quot;

# switch to workspace
bindsym $mod+1 workspace $ws1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace $ws2
bindsym $mod+3 workspace $ws3
bindsym $mod+4 workspace $ws4
bindsym $mod+5 workspace $ws5
bindsym $mod+6 workspace $ws6

# move focused container to workspace
bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move container to workspace $ws1
bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace $ws2
bindsym $mod+Shift+3 move container to workspace $ws3
bindsym $mod+Shift+4 move container to workspace $ws4
bindsym $mod+Shift+5 move container to workspace $ws5
bindsym $mod+Shift+6 move container to workspace $ws6
</code></pre><p>Now whenever we would like to change the title of a workspace, we can do it
in just one place and have it take effect everywhere.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: When changing the workspace names, you may experience strange
behavior after an i3 restart such as the old workspace persisting. To correct
these issues, simply exit i3 (and your X Session) by using the Mod+Shift+q key
combination and restart it (log back in).</strong></em></p>
<h4 id="using-x-server-properties-in-i3">Using X Server Properties in i3</h4>
<p>When a program is started, it is responsible for setting display window and
font properties in an X Server. These properties can be used by window managers
to define specific actions for a group of application windows during an event
(i.e. window opening, connecting an external monitor, etc.) For instance, you can
set your i3 config to always place google chrome on workspace 4. In order to do
this though, we&rsquo;ll have to know the X Server properties of a window. To find
these properties, we can use a program called <em>xprop</em>. In Arch Linux, xprop is
part of the xorg-utils package (<code>sudo pacman -S xorg-utils</code>). In order to see
the properties of a program&rsquo;s window, first open the program, then in a
terminal run <code>xprop</code>. The cursor should turn into a cross hair and you should
click on the window for which you would like to see the properties. After
clicking on the window, output similar to the following should print to the
terminal where you launched the xprop program:</p>
<pre><code>XdndTypeList(ATOM) = STRING, UTF8_STRING, text/plain, text/x-moz-url, TEXT, _NETSCAPE_URL, chromium/x-renderer-taint, text/html
_NET_WM_DESKTOP(CARDINAL) = 3

                program specified minimum size: 771 by 92
WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = &quot;ricing arch : Maxwell J. Morgan - Google Chrome&quot;

WM_CLIENT_MACHINE(STRING) = &quot;ArchTop&quot;
WM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  WM_DELETE_WINDOW, _NET_WM_PING
</code></pre><p>The most useful property when configuring i3 will be the window class which is
specified as the second value of WM_CLASS(STRING). In the above output, we can
see google chrome&rsquo;s window class property is &lsquo;Google-chrome&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In order to specify that google chrome should always open on workspace 4 we can
use i3&rsquo;s <code>assign</code> command like so:</p>

<h4 id="setting-gaps-in-i3-gaps">Setting Gaps in i3-gaps</h4>
<p>i3-gaps will not automatically configure the gaps between windows for you so
in order to do so, you must remove the window borders and specify a gap size.
This can be done by adding the following lines to the end of your
configuration file:</p>
<pre><code># i3 gaps specific stuff below #

# disable borders
for_window [class=&quot;^.*&quot;] border pixel 0

gaps inner 15  # gap size in pixels
</code></pre><h3 id="wrapping-things-up">Wrapping Things Up</h3>
<p>I hope I shed a bit of light on the art of ricing and more specifically how to
get up and running with a window manager. Even though I specifically covered
i3, most window managers are installed similarly though the configuration
syntax will most likely differ. It&rsquo;s all really a matter of
packages, configuration files, and shell scripts. The hardest part is knowing
where all the files live, the configuration syntax, and working out the kinks!</p>
<p>I barely scratched the surface of what you can do with i3 and with a riced
system in general. I plan on writing more posts in the future covering the
various other visual components of an operating system including terminal
emulators (and X resources in general), status bars, widget themes, and other
tidbits like composition managers, application launchers, etc.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll explore more operating system customizations! Here are some extra
resources to keep you going:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html">i3 Window Manager Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager">Window Manager Wiki Article</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/mjmor/dot">My dotfile repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the shameless plug to the unix porn reddit community which inspired
me to get into ricing in the first place:</p>
